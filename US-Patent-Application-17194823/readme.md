# Prosecution
From 03/08/2021	to the present, hundreds of documents have been filed in support of this application. 
However, the USPTO illegally deemed this patent abandoned.
I am continuing to fight for this.
I have included some prosecution documents in this folder for referrence. 
I have done everything requested of the PTO to date, however it is clear the PTO has malicious intentions in their interactions and analysis.
The PTO has demonstrated a blatant and overt disrespect for the law of the United States under Title 35 of the U.S. Code throughout the prosecution process.

I have also continued to file more patent applications for this technology, which I invented for the purpose of curing the disease with which I was born, hypothytoidism. 
While it will take at least 15 years to build and bring this technology to market given the current conditions for healthcare and biotechnology innovation in the United States, I hope to achieve this within my lifetime.
