# Prosecution
From 03/08/2021	to the present, hundreds of documents have been filed in support of this application. 
However, the USPTO illegally deemed this patent abandoned.
I am continuing to fight for this.

I have also continued to file more patent applications for this technology, which I invented for the purpose of curing the disease with which I was born, hypothytoidism. 
While it will take at least 15 years to build and bring this technology to market given the current conditions for healthcare and biotechnology innovation in the United States, I hope to achieve this within my lifetime.
